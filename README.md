# TicTacToe
Project Group created @ <Bootcamp #64>.

//Description

The challenge: 
Create a server to serve a game in 48hours.

//Idea

Our Idea was to re-create the famous game TicTacToe and make a multiplayer version where the game could be played at several machines at the same time.

//Development

We split tasks to be able to create and deploy the game in 48 hours.
Part of the group was in charge of developing the graphic and logical part of the game (The Client APP overall), while the others were developing the Server APP.
We manage to create a Server from scratch (sockets, dealing with requests and concurrence, etc.) and make a functional and appealing game!

//Technologies

Java, OOP, SimpleGraphics Library, IntelliJ IDE, Apache Ant.
