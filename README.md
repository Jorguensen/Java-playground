# TicTacToe
Project Group created @ <Bootcamp #64>.

//Description

This was our first group project! We had little over 4 weeks of experience working with Java and the task was to create a functional game from scratch applying the technologies we had been working with. The deadline for the project? 10 Nights - from 8 PM to 8 AM.

//Idea

We came up with the idea of recreating the traditional Battleship Game with some twists like a graphic design alusive to our Bootcamp Group - The LooneyTunes!

//Development First we created a UML diagram where we defined all the game structure (Classes, relations between objects, etc.). Then we created the features needed one by one: A Grid (Field) to place the boats, the Boats and Positions. After that we develop the game mechanics, such has 'How to shoot', 'Mark the shooted positions'. As well as, an NPC player to play against. To wrap up the game we added sound effects and the graphic design.

//Technologies

Java, OOP, SimpleGraphics Library, IntelliJ IDE, Apache Ant.
